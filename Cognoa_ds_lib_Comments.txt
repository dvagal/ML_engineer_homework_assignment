feature_selection.py
----------------------
	input: dataframe  (input columns)
	output: dataframe with columns 'feature', 'XValid_AUC', 'autism_recall', 'not_recall'
	Edits:
		removing the imports of several libraries that are not being used
		removed both min_severity & max_severity functions and generalized to one function that handles both min & max severities
		removed the repetition of several lines of count of severity
	Comment:
		min_severity function that is present in the code is never used.
	Bug:
		Fixed the min_severity column that is previously taking the values of max_severity function
		
ds_helper_functions.py
----------------------
edits:
	removing unused imports
	bringing import lines to the top for readability


inconclusive_classifier.py
--------------------------
bug fix:
	fixed the usage of print_classifier_performance_metrics by importing it from ds_helper_functions
ds_helper_functions
sklearn_0p18_bridge_code.py



independent script files (not called by another script):
--------------------------------------------------------
v1_video_algorithms.py
plotting_tools.py

edits:
removed unused imports in between scripts

ADOS_helper_functions
ADOSMissingDataInstructions


Best practices:
---------------
1.Always keep the statements related to import functions at the top of the code (Readability, Conformance to standards and best practices)
2. keep functions separate, try not to define & create a nested function (function inside a function)  
3. Always include error handling and exception handling 


Nice to have features:
----------------------
1. cprofile for performance check, need data to use this
2. cpickle for loading/saving the previous versions of python objects for rollback
3. A workflow manager tool like Luigi or Airflow to build an analytics data pipeline end to end and schedule in Production.
